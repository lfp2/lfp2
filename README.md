My name is LavÃ­nia Paganini (she/her), I'm from Brazil ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·. I'm currently a Master's student of Computer Science at the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.
I love hackathons and the ability to create projects in a short-time frame. ğŸ’» However, during my time at these events, I noticed a small amount of women joining - so I co-created [Hack Grrrl](https://hackgrrrl.com/).
I also make [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FfyAp2AAAAAJ)ğŸ“œ about gender diversity in hackathons and STEM.
