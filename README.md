My name is LavÃ­nia Paganini (she/her), I'm from Brazil ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·. I live in the Netherlands ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡±, as a PhD in Mathematics and Computer Science at TU/e.
I love hackathons and the ability to create projects in a short-time frame. ğŸ’» However, while at these events, I noticed a few women joining - so I co-created [Hack Grrrl](https://hackgrrrl.com/).
I also do [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FfyAp2AAAAAJ)ğŸ“œ about gender diversity in hackathons and STEM.
